**Key Technical Contributions:**

**Infrastructure & DevOps:**

- **AWS Architecture:** Designed serverless solutions using Lambda, API Gateway, S3, SQS
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Implemented comprehensive Terraform modules for AWS resource
  management
- **Continuous Integration:** Established automated deployment pipelines and testing frameworks
- **Monitoring:** Set up application metrics and alerting using CloudWatch and Grafana

**Development Excellence:**

- **Contract Testing:** Led Pact framework training and implementation across multiple teams
- **Knowledge Transfer:** Conducted active and passive handover sessions, including technical
  training workshops
- **Code Quality:** Applied Clean Code principles across 13+ repositories with measurable
  improvements
- **Framework Innovation:** Created reusable templates and architectural patterns adopted team-wide

**Integration & Communication:**

- **Third-party Integration:** Seamless Salesforce, Zuora, and Twilio API integration
- **Event-driven Architecture:** Designed message delivery systems with complex routing and priority
  handling
- **Cross-team Collaboration:** Worked across Subscription and MARS teams ensuring architectural
  consistency

**Repository Contributions:**
Contributed to 13+ repositories including:

- zuora-create-invoice-lambda, zuora-lambdas, zuora-microservices
- myts (customer portal), template-service, message-delivery-service
- send-sms-function, twilio-message-webhook, mars-invite-reminder
- terraform-subscription, docker-myts

**Impact:**

- **Technical Debt Reduction:** Successfully modernized legacy JavaEE6 systems reducing maintenance
  overhead
- **Scalability Achievement:** Microservices architecture on AWS supporting business growth

**Lessons Learned:**

- **Microservices Architecture Reality:** First encounter with a real microservices architecture,
  surprised by the lived disadvantages. Simple changes often required modifications across many
  microservices, and lack of testing and automation made maintaining the microservices difficult.
  Unfortunately, the IT architecture was not open to change. Since this project, I have been
  skeptical of microservices as an overarching IT architecture and prefer Self-contained Systems
  (as later implemented at 
  [Union Investment](#october-2021--december-2024-cloud-architect-at-union-investment)).

### August 2007 — June 2014: PHP Developer and Head of Development at werkenntwen

*wer-kennt-wen.de (lemonline media ltd. / werkenntwen GmbH) | Permanent Position*

**Company Context:**

- One of Germany's largest social networks with 9+ million members
- Platform for connecting users and finding old acquaintances
- Founded October 2006, acquired by RTL interactive (RTL Deutschland media group) in February 2009
- Company ceased operations June 30, 2014

**Career Path:**

- PHP Developer (Aug 2007 — Oct 2008)
- Head of Development (Oct 2008 — Mar 2010)
- Backend Developer (Apr 2010 — Jun 30 2014)

**Key Development Contributions:**

- **Architecture modernization:** Led transformation from procedural to object-oriented architecture
  using multi-layered MVC patterns
- **Framework migration:** Migrated complete group system and messaging system from legacy code to
  Zend Framework
- **API development:** Created REST-compliant API with WADL description for mobile platform
- **Mobile platform:** Developed HTML mobile portal and API foundation
- **Scaling solutions:** Implemented vertical/horizontal table partitioning and extensive Memcache
  deployment
- **Security implementation:** Deployed comprehensive security measures (Brute-force protection,
  XSS, CSRF, SQL-injection prevention, ACL)

**Head of Development Responsibilities (2008 — 2010):**

- **Change management:** Complete change-request management and roadmap creation
- **Architecture planning:** Software architecture design using UML modeling
- **Process development:** Created new workflows, procedures, and interface definitions
- **Release management:** Managed platform updates and major releases including deployment
- **Quality assurance:** Implemented code reviews, software metrics (StatSVN, phploc), and testing
  standards
- **Team leadership:** Personnel planning, recruitment, onboarding, and performance evaluation
- **Load testing:** Prepared and executed platform stress testing

**Key Failures and Lessons Learned:**

- **Leadership Experience Gap:** Accepted the Head of Development role without sufficient management
  experience. Both company leadership and I incorrectly assumed technical competence would translate
  to effective leadership. Initially underestimated the human factor in management, focusing
  primarily on technical aspects. Through training and reflection, developed understanding of team
  dynamics and evolved toward a laissez-faire leadership style that better suited both my
  personality and team needs.

- **Technology Decision: Sphinx vs. ElasticSearch:** Selected Sphinx search engine over
  ElasticSearch due to familiarity, despite ElasticSearch offering more advanced features that
  seemed exotic at the time. This conservative choice proved suboptimal as ElasticSearch's feature
  set became industry standard. The platform later migrated from Sphinx to ElasticSearch during my
  return as Backend Developer, validating that the more innovative choice would have been better
  long-term.

**Technical Achievements:**

- **CI/CD implementation:** Introduced Continuous Integration using Jenkins (expanded from PHP to
  Java projects)
- **Testing excellence:** Achieved high PHPUnit test coverage with CodeCoverage analysis
- **Performance optimization:** Utilized Xdebug profiling for performance improvements
- **Search integration:** Evaluated and implemented Sphinx for scalable search functionality
- **Parallel processing:** Created parallelized PHP command-line execution environment

**Impact:**

- **Platform scalability:** Successfully scaled architecture for 9+ million registered users
- **Team leadership:** Managed development team with full personnel responsibility
- **Performance improvements:** Reduced page load times by 60% through architecture modernization
- **Process improvement:** Introduced automated and manual testing procedures including Selenium

**Technologies & Frameworks:**

- **Backend:** PHP, Zend Framework, OOP architecture, MVC patterns
- **Database:** MySQL with advanced partitioning and optimization
- **Caching:** Memcache implementation for performance scaling
- **CI/CD:** Jenkins, automated deployment pipelines
- **Testing:** PHPUnit, Selenium, automated quality assurance
- **APIs:** REST API development, WADL documentation
- **Search:** Sphinx search engine integration
- **Monitoring:** Xdebug profiling, StatSVN, phploc metrics

  and sometimes full-time as a software developer
  [starting in 2007](#august-2007--june-2014-php-developer-and-head-of-development-at-werkenntwen),
  which delayed my studies but provided valuable practical experience alongside academic learning.

*The German [Diploma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplom) degree is equivalent to a Master of
Science and was awarded with distinction, representing academic excellence in the field of Computer
Science with specialization in Computational Visualistics.*

### 2003: Abitur (German high school diploma)

**School:** Gymnasium Haren (Ems), Germany  
**Graduation:** May 24, 2003  
**Advanced Courses:** Mathematics and Physics

I attended high school at the Gymnasium in Haren (Ems, DE). I was more interested in technical
subjects and took math and physics as advanced courses in high school.

I had my first contact with IT during my school years. In the sixth grade, I attended a typing
course. Unfortunately, this was my last contact with PCs at school. Later, in the years 2000-2003, I
taught myself PHP using a PHP reference. Equipped with this knowledge, I created homepages including
a forum for my friend group and later for my graduating class.

Typically, I also discovered computer games for myself. This led to my decision to study Computer
Visualistics in Koblenz.
